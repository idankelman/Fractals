Fractals and recursion
A fractal is a never-ending pattern. Fractals
are infinitely complex patterns that are
self-similar across different scales.
They are created by repeating a
simple process over and over in an ongoing
feedback loop.
Driven by recursion,
fractals are images of dynamic systems ג€“
the pictures of Chaos.
Geometrically, they exist in between our familiar
dimensions. Fractal patterns are extremely familiar,
since nature is full of fractals. For instance:
trees, rivers, coastlines, mountains, clouds, seashells,
hurricanes, etc.
Abstract fractals ג€“ such as the Mandelbrot Set ג€“
can be generated by a computer
calculating a simple equation over and over,
and as a computer sience engineer , i like
to be able to show to people the beauty of
the math in practice , using recursuin..
